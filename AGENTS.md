# AGENTS.md

Working notes for AI coding agents in baskingspot/testingx.

## What this is

A test runner that replaces the built-in one, and benchmarks that sit beside your tests. It is incubating: unstable, with no promises about its API.

## Environment

Zig 0.16 only. The flake is the tool contract, from `baskingspot/nix`: `nix develop` provides Zig, `ziglint`, and the base tools, and nothing comes from the system PATH. The justfile is the command interface: `just test`, `just lint`, `just ci`. Run `just fmt` before you commit.

## Rules

- Commit messages are one line, `area: summary`, and every commit is signed. Do not rewrite pushed history.
- Gate commands on their exit codes, and claim only what you ran.
- Format with `zig fmt` and lint with `ziglint`. `just fmt` and `just lint` run both.
- This repo's GitHub settings come from `baskingspot/.github`, with `just settings`. Do not change them by hand.
- To graduate the project, follow the `baskingspot-new-repo` skill: logos, a real README, and the audit passing.
